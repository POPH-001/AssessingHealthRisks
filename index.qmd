## [3]{.circle}[**Concepts of Causation**]{style="color: teal;"}


- **<span style="color: brown;">Necessary Cause</span>:** A cause that must be present for an effect to occur.
- **<span style="color: brown;">Sufficient Cause</span>:** A cause that inevitably produces the effect.
- **<span style="color: brown;">Remote vs. Proximate Causes</span>:** Understanding causal chains and effect proximity.

## [3]{.circle}[**Concepts of Causation**]{style="color: teal;"}


- **<span style="color: silver;">Hume's</span> Criteria:** 
  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Spatio-temporal Continuity**</span> – The cause and effect must occur close together in space and time.
  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Temporal Priority**</span> – The cause must always come before the effect.
  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Necessary Connection**</span> – There must be an expectation that the <span style="color: magenta;">effect must follow the cause</span>, though Hume argued this is something our minds impose rather than an inherent property of reality.

## [3]{.circle}[**Concepts of Causation**]{style="color: teal;"}

- **<span style="color: silver;">Mill’s</span> Five Methods of Inductive Reasoning**: Agreement, difference, joint method, residues, and concomitant variations.
  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Agreement**</span> – If two or more cases of an event share only one common factor, then that factor is likely the cause of the event.
    -   *<span style="color: blue;">Example*</span>: If multiple people who ate at a restaurant got food poisoning and the only dish they all ate was the salad, then the salad is likely the cause.

  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Method of difference**</span> – If an event occurs in one case but not in another, and the only difference between them is one factor, then that factor is likely the cause.
    -   *<span style="color: blue;">Example*</span>: If two people follow the same diet, but only one develops an allergy after eating a particular fruit, the fruit is likely the cause.

## [3]{.circle}[**Concepts of Causation**]{style="color: teal;"}

- **<span style="color: silver;">Mill’s</span> Five Methods of Inductive Reasoning**: Agreement, difference, joint method, residues, and concomitant variations.
  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Joint method**</span> – A combination of the first two methods (1) Identify a common factor across cases where an event occurs, and (2) Ensure that when the factor is absent, the event does not occur..
    -   *<span style="color: blue;">Example*</span>: If people who drink contaminated water get sick, and those who don’t drink it remain healthy, then the contaminated water is likely the cause.

  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Method of Residues**</span> – If known causes are accounted for, and there is still an unexplained effect, the remaining factor(s) must be responsible for the residual effect.
    -   *<span style="color: blue;">Example*</span>: If a medication has multiple ingredients and the effects of some ingredients are already known, but a new side effect appears, it is likely caused by the ingredient whose effects are still unknown.

- **<span style="color: silver;">Mill’s</span> Five Methods of Inductive Reasoning**: Agreement, difference, joint method, residues, and concomitant variations.
  -   <span style="color: gold;">**Concomitant variations**</span> – If a factor varies in intensity along with an effect, there is likely a causal connection.
    -   *<span style="color: blue;">Example*</span>: If increased smoking leads to increased lung cancer rates, and reduced smoking leads to lower rates, smoking is likely a cause of lung cancer.

## [3]{.circle}[**Concepts of Causation**]{style="color: teal;"}

- **<span style="color: silver;">Bradford Hill's</span> Criteria:**

  - 1 <span style="color: gold;">**Strength & Consistency**</span> – A strong and repeated association across studies increases the likelihood of causation.
  - 2 <span style="color: gold;">**Specificity & Temporality**</span> – The cause should lead to a specific effect, and the effect must occur **after** the cause.  
  - 3 <span style="color: gold;">**Biological Gradient & Plausibility**</span> – A dose-response relationship should exist, and the cause should make biological sense.  
  - 4 <span style="color: gold;">**Coherence & Experiment**</span> – The evidence should align with existing knowledge, and experiments should support the causal link.  
  - 5 <span style="color: gold;">**Analogy** </span>– If similar factors cause similar effects, the association is more credible.

- **<span style="color: silver;">Henle-Koch's</span> Postulates:**

  - 1. <span style="color: gold;">**Agent Presence**</span> – The microorganism must be found in all cases of the disease.
  - 2. <span style="color: gold;">**Isolation**</span> – The microorganism must be isolated and grown in pure culture.
  - 3. <span style="color: gold;">**Disease Causation**</span> – Introducing the isolated microorganism into a healthy host should cause the disease.
  - 4. <span style="color: gold;">**Reisolation**</span> – The microorganism must be re-isolated from the newly infected host.
  - 5. <span style="color: gold;">**Consistency**</span> – These findings should be repeatable across multiple cases.

## [4]{.circle}[**Measures of Association**]{style="color: teal;"}


- **Ratio Measures:** Relative risk, risk ratio, rate ratio, odds ratio.
- **Difference Measures:** Risk difference or attributable risk.
- **Relative Risk (RR):** $RR = \frac{I_1}{I_0}$
- **Odds Ratio (OR):** $OR = \frac{(a/c)}{(b/d)} = \frac{ad}{bc}$
- **Risk Difference (RD):** $RD = I_1 - I_0$
- **Attributable Risk Among the Exposed [AR(E)]:** $AR(E) = \frac{(I_1 - I_0)}{I_1} = \frac{(RR - 1)}{RR}$
- **Population Attributable Risk (PAR):** $PAR = \frac{(I - I_0)}{I} = \frac{P(RR - 1)}{P(RR - 1) + 1}$

## [5]{.circle}[**Competing Risks**]{style="color: teal;"}

- **Definition:** Recognizes that individuals are exposed to multiple risks, where one event prevents another.
- **Importance:** Essential for understanding mortality trends and disease impact.
- **Statistical Approaches:** Methods to estimate death probability in competing risks.

## [6]{.circle}[**Risk Perception and Communication**]{style="color: teal;"}


- **Subjectivity of Risk:** Public perception differs from expert assessments.
- **Social Construction of Risk:** Influences include social, cultural, and political factors.
- **Factors Influencing Risk Acceptance:** Fair distribution, benefits, alternatives, voluntary vs. imposed risks, and control.
- **Biases in Probability Assessment:** Representativeness, anchoring, and availability.
- **Effective Risk Communication:** Public involvement, planning, listening, honesty, coordination, media engagement, clarity, and compassion.
